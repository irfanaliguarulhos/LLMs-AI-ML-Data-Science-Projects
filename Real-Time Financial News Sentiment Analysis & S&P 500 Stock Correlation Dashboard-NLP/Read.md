## ✨ Overview

This interactive dashboard aims to bridge the gap between breaking financial news and stock market reactions. It performs the following key tasks:

1.  **Data Aggregation:** Fetches near real-time financial news headlines (via NewsAPI) and historical S&P 500 (SPY) price data (via yfinance).
2.  **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes a pre-trained **FinBERT** model (fine-tuned for financial text) to classify the sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) of news headlines.
3.  **Correlation Analysis:** Calculates the rolling correlation between the aggregated daily news sentiment score and the SPY's daily price changes.
4.  **Price Prediction:** Employs a Long Short-Term Memory (**LSTM**) neural network, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to forecast future SPY closing prices based on historical price patterns.
5.  **AI Summary:** Uses a **DistilGPT-2** language model to generate a concise textual summary of the current market situation based on the latest data, sentiment, correlation, and LSTM predictions.
6.  **Interactive Dashboard:** Presents all insights through a user-friendly web interface built with **Plotly Dash**, allowing users to select date ranges, trigger model retraining, update sentiment data, and generate AI summaries on demand.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/irfanaliguarulhos/LLMs-AI-ML-Data-Science-Projects.git
    cd "LLMs-AI-ML-Data-Science-Projects/Real-Time Financial News Sentiment Analysis & SP 500 Stock Correlation Dashboard (NLP)"
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: Installation might take some time, especially for PyTorch/TensorFlow).*

4.  **Set Up API Key:**
    *   Get a free API key from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/).
    *   Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
    *   Open the `.env` file and paste your actual NewsAPI key:
        ```text
        NEWSAPI_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_NEWSAPI_KEY_HERE"
        ```

5.  **Run the Dashboard:**
    ```bash
    python market_pulse_dashboard.py

6.  **Access the Dashboard:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8050` (or the address provided in the terminal). The initial data loading and model training might take a minute or two the first time.

## 🖱️ Usage

*   **Date Range Picker:** Select a start and end date to filter the data displayed in the graphs.
*   **Train LSTM & Predict Button:** Click to retrain the LSTM model using all available historical data up to the latest point. This updates the prediction line on the price graph and the LSTM performance metrics.
*   **Update Sentiment Data Button:** Fetches the latest news headlines, runs sentiment analysis, re-merges the data, and updates the sentiment metrics. *Note: This resets the prediction line as it's based on potentially new data.* You'll need to click "Train LSTM" again for updated predictions.
*   **Generate AI Summary Button:** Click to generate a textual summary based on the *currently available* data, sentiment metrics, and LSTM predictions (either initial or after retraining).

## 💡 How It Works (Pipeline)

1.  **Data Fetching:** Retrieves SPY prices (`yfinance`) and news (`NewsAPI`).
2.  **Sentiment Analysis:** Processes news titles with `FinBERT` to get sentiment scores.
3.  **Preprocessing & Merging:** Aggregates daily sentiment and merges it with stock data. Calculates `price_change` and `sentiment_price_corr`. Ensures data types are correct.
4.  **LSTM Training:** Prepares time-series sequences from 'Close' prices, scales data, builds, trains, and validates the LSTM model.
5.  **Prediction:** Uses the trained LSTM to predict future 'Close' prices on the test set.
6.  **AI Summary Generation:** Feeds key metrics (latest price, sentiment, correlation, prediction trend, accuracy) into `DistilGPT-2` via a structured prompt to get a summary.
7.  **Dashboard Display:** `Dash` uses `Plotly` to visualize the data and predictions. Callbacks handle user interactions (button clicks, date changes) to trigger updates and recalculations.

## 🔮 Potential Improvements & Future Work

*   **More Data Sources:** Integrate other sentiment sources (Twitter, Reddit, StockTwits).
*   **Advanced Models:** Experiment with different LSTM architectures (BiLSTM, Attention), other time-series models (GRU, ARIMA, Prophet), or incorporate sentiment scores directly into the prediction model features.
*   **Real-time Streaming:** Implement data fetching and updates on a schedule or via streaming APIs for true real-time analysis (would require a more robust architecture).
*   **Deployment:** Deploy the dashboard to a cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud) for public access.
*   **Error Handling:** Add more granular error handling and user feedback within the dashboard.
*   **Backtesting:** Implement a backtesting framework to evaluate the prediction model's historical performance more rigorously.
*   **Caching:** Use caching mechanisms (e.g., Flask-Caching with Dash) to speed up repeated data loading or calculations.
